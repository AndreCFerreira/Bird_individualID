[Raspberry pi]( https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/) is a single-board low cost computer initially designed to promote teaching of computer science in developing countries, but as cough the interest of researchers in recent years (Cressey, D. (2017). Age of the arduino. Nature, 544(7648), 125-126.)

In other to use a raspberry pi you need to format a microSD (minimum 16gb) to fat32 format (you can check [this site]( https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sdxc_formatting.md) for more information).
If itâ€™s you first time using a raspberry pi we recommend installing Raspbian operating system using [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/). Extract the content of the zip file to the formatted microSD card and insert it on the raspberry pi.
Connect a keyboard and mouse on the usb ports of the raspberry pi and screen using a hdmi cable. After loading the system check the checkbox for the raspebian operating system, click on install and confirm.
