Implementation of the paper Individual visual identification using deep learning in wild birds link

This repository explains how to automatize collection of training pictures using RFID in birds, pre-process images and train convolutional neural networks for individual identification.
The project is organized as follow:
1)	Automated_pictures_collection: raspberry pi communication with RFID data logger to build a camera trap with automatic labelling.
2)	Data_pre-processing: localize and extract birds (or the body part of interest) from the pictures
3)	Train_CNN: training the convolutional neural network for individual identification
4)	Work_flow_example: applying the trained model to a situation of interest
