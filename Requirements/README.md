Instructions given in this repository are meant to be used using a machine with a linux operating system installed (in our case we used [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS ](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) 
We also assume that readers are already aware that deep Learning is very computationally intensive and therefore have access to a computer with the minimum requirements for their project. In our case we used a computer with 64gb RAM and a GPU nvidia RTX2070. 
We recommend installing python 3.x using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). It is useful to work with anaconda python as it allows creating conda isolated environments that can contain different versions of Python and/or installed packages. Anaconda also automatically installs jupyter notebook which is an interactive computing environment that enables users to easily create, edit and share documents that containing code.
After installing python a conda environment named “individualID” can create a conda environment by typing in Linux terminal.
```console
conda create -n individualID python=3.7
```
You can then activate the conda environment by typing:
```console
source activate individualID
```
After activating the virtual environment the packages needed to run the scripts in this repository can be installed by typing in the linux terminal
```console
pip install 
pip install 
pip install 
```
